I recently was working on a assignment concerning wellness for a health class and at some point it asked, "List two ways your friends can impact your wellness." Of course this was a routine assignment so I answered it with something generic about friends being accepting of who you are. Not to say that it is not important for friends to accept you for who you are, but more that it is a very commonly propagated sentiment. Before I submitted the assignment though, it reminded me about something I had written a while ago, almost a year prior, in a text message.

Back when I was younger and more naive by about a year, one of my friends had asked me a question about love. It was a pretty simple question. Unfortunately, this was one of those questions that gained its complexity from its simplicity. A question embodying the commonplace that "less is more". One where the shortness is less an invitation for a short answer, but an invitation to compensate for the question's shortness with the most philosophically deep response contemplating the human condition that you will ever write. I'll stop beating around the bush. The question was something along the lines of "what does it mean to love someone?"

I know, I know. You feel like that question was incredibly overhyped. I concede, the exaggeration of the question was mostly done for the point of lengthening the second paragraph. Despite this slight exaggeration, the question still stuck with me. I of course began to think about the question far too deeply and could not come up with an answer I felt was worthy of being sent back to my friend. And so like a bear going to hibernate for the winter, the question went to sleep in my mind, *never to be answered for the rest of my life...*

*Of course,* in reality, the question, like the sleeping bear, will wake up, and it will be very hungry. In this, our question is very hungry for an answer, prowling the forest of knowledge for anything it can devour. I should mention that this bear did not wake up naturally. This bear was *prodded* and *stabbed* until it woke from its slumber. (I will admit that "stabbed" is a bit of a strong word, but "prodded" is definitely valid.) This bear had not just an appetite for an answer, but quite some anger at whatever had painfully poked it out of its hibernation.

So here I am, somewhat broken and in a highly emotionally confused state, deciding that this is the perfect time to revisit this highly subjective question in an attempt to give it an objective answer. What could possibly go wrong?
