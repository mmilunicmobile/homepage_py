When I first made this website, I wanted it mosty to be a home to articles. I have somewhat failed to actually populate this website with articles so far, but that's just because I'm so darn busy. I have plenty of things I need to spend time on, schoolwork, homework, extracurriculars, etc. Anyway, the main point of this is that if I want to be able to write an article, I need to be able to do it quickly and without much strife, hence the simple markdown formatter which I am able to use to make nice(ish) looking pages for your viewing pleasure in relatively short amounts of time. 

Although the backend may not be completely optimized, and the website may completely re‑render a page ever time you make a request for a page, all I need to do is add a file. No need to run some fancy build command, no need to learn some crazy Javascript library just to put some text online, just good, old fashioned, PHP. A few of you may find this system appaling, and with good reason, but it is currently good enough for me. Well, *almost*...

## The Problem

Other than having long loading times for doing stuff, my web pages also have no way of changing without me modifying them.

Now, this is especially annoying since a lot of information like the fact that todays date is {todays_date} changes quite often. I mean, if I had to change the page manually *every single time* I wanted to update it, it would be very difficult for me to let you know that {r.text}

This my friend is due to a wonderful thing known as on the fly page generation! To put it simply, I have a flag in the article metadata section of my website that tells the page loader whether a page is a Markdown file, or a Python script that prints out Markdown. If it is the former it simply renders it as I have detailed in previous articles. If it is a Python script, it runs the script, taking the output and treating that as a Markdown file. This may sound as though some security concerns may arise, but since I have no user input, it is very unlikely that any attacks arise.

## User Input

Scratch that I now have user input. 

Look at this fun little input box right below me!

Type something in it, and when you're done, it'll make a quote down below! Now. Here's the deal. This isn't getting sent back to my server because of, as I said earlier, *security risks*. I just do not have enough time or stress allowance to make sure there are no loopholes or exploits that slipped through the cracks, so currently there is no way of code other than exactly what I wrote executing on my computer. The interactivity on the web page is actually just JavaScript running on the webpage as we speak! This is done by using a pure HTML tag that breaks out of the default markdown behavior so I can create more freely. This freedom includes the <script></script> tags and allows me to add shallow interactivity to my website. 

This combination of items allows for two types of dynamic capabilities for the website. I of course gave these cool names, as why not, and here they are:
* Deep Immutability
* Shallow Mutability

The core of **deep immutability** is that you can have very deep access and ability to run code on a server, but in a way that is inexploitable and safe. In a way, the server is **deeper** than the webpage being served but is **immutable** unlike the webpage. Additionally **deep immutability** adds the ability to obscure the inner workings of something in case I ever want to do that. On the other hand the webpage itself with its JavaScript is very **shallow** in comparison, existing soley on a runtime on the browser, but this containment allows for safe **mutability** of the site without compromizing the security of the server.

## Conclusions

Yes, I understand there are better ways to do stuff like this, but this was mostly a learning experience. The next major improvement to the site I will likely be trying out is going to be caching pages to clean up on load times. Theoretically these pages should load pretty fast for almost anyone's computer, but the actual rendering of them on the server side does add some time. Also, now I can officially say this site is...
